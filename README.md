Introduction:

Imagine you're a chef who has been trained in various cooking techniques and recipes from around the world. One day, a customer comes in and asks for a dish you've never made before. Instead of going back to culinary school or spending weeks practicing this new recipe, you're handed a few example dishes with their recipes right there in the kitchen.
You quickly look over these examples, noticing the ingredients used, the cooking methods applied, and the presentation style. Drawing on your vast cooking knowledge and the patterns you've just observed, you're able to create a dish in the same style, even though you've never made it before.
This is essentially how In-Context Learning works for large language models. The model, like our chef, has been pre-trained on a vast amount of data. When given a new task along with a few examples (the 'context'), it can quickly adapt and perform the task without needing to be retrained.
